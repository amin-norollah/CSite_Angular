# Car Store Site (CSite) Web Application using Angular


(I decided to change many things from this project, so I created this new repository and am trying to upgrade my Angular code according to my new back-end project. So, I am developing it now, and it is not ready yet.)

This project is part of the full web application project and developed for educational purposes only. I used various libraries and methods in order to manage the project I will list them in the future after the project will be completed.


## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
